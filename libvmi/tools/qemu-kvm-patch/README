This patch provides one way for LibVMI to access memory from a running KVM
virtual machine.  To start, you need the source code for QEMU-KVM 0.14.0.

tar zxvf qemu-kvm-0.14.0.tar.gz
cd qemu-kvm-0.14.0
patch -p1 < ../kvm-physmem-access_0.14.0.patch
./configure
make
make install

At this point you should make any other changes necessary to ensure that
your system used this newly installed version of qemu-kvm when running KVM
virtual machines.  You will then be able to access the memory of each
running virtual machine using LibVMI.

Update (12 Oct 2012):
Thanks to John Floren, we now have a patch for Qemu 1.2.0.  See the 
kvm-physmem-access_1.2.0.patch file.
